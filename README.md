# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2023

My [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions on TypeScript & Bun. 

The code is a balanace between clarity, pefrormance, and my ability to spend time improving it. I also leave [explanatory comments](https://github.com/artemtam/aoc2023/blob/ff3d63b42fd5f4d9079f0cf0bb4a9e76b702a867/src/day-06/solution.ts#L36), so if you're stuck and want to better understand thought process behind, this repository might be helpful.

### Running locally

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) has to be installed, then:

```bash
bun install
bun test
```
